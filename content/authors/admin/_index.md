I'm currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student of [WiTech Lab](https://www.witechlab.com/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Swarun Kumar](https://swarunkumar.com/). I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2021 with the Guo Moruo Scholarship (Highest honor for USTC students). I'm also honored to work with [Prof. Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/) at UMass Amherst during 2019-2020.
